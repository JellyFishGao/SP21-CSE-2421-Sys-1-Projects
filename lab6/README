Name: Zheyuan Gao

I certify that I completed all of the work myself with no aid from anyone aside from the instructor or the undergraduate graders.

Part 1:

Q1: 
“Im big fan of small word. No like big word or good grammar. Grammar too hard.”
“I really hate how nice the weather is getting.”
“What”
“Amazing, isnt it? With just the slightest touch the material warps around the skin effortlessly.”
“Can you believe how much ligma is going around this year?”

Q2:
Step 1: Please go to line 213: "subq $40, %rsp". Change the 40 to (8*number of strings total). This will allocating space on stack for string pointers array.
Step 2: Please go to line 215: "movq $5, %r12". Change the 5 to the total number of strings provided for the program.
Step 3: Please check line 217-230. This part of code add string's address to the pointer array %rbx. 
If you would like to add more string to test, you can simply copy and paste:
"incq %r13
 movq $str#, (%rbx,%r13,8) " where # will be the index of new string.

If you like to delete existing string, you can delete one of the section of:
"incq %r13
 movq $str#, (%rbx,%r13,8)" where # will be the index of an existing string.

Thank you for reading this instructions.:) I am sorry if these are not well indented.
